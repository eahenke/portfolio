# Easy Grids

## About
This single-page application generates CSS for custom grid system based on a user's inputs.  The user may choose number of columns, space between columns (gutters), column padding, and space between rows.  A visual preview of the grid system displays when the user changes a preference.  The page makes an AJAX call to a PHP script that generates the CSS and returns it to the page.  Copy and paste the code into your project.
