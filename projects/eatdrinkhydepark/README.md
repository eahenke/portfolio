# Eat Drink Hyde Park

## About
This single-page application displays a map of restaurants and bars in Chicago's Hyde Park Neighborhood.  It uses the Google Places API to pull a list of places fitting the given criteria (bar and/or restaurant), filters out places with incomplete information, and sorts the rest into either restaurant or bar lists.  It then plots those places on a map using the Google Maps API.  One may click the sidebar list or a marker to show an information window displaying the name, address and website of the given restaurant or bar.  The sidebar contains an item for each place, along with rating and pricing information.
